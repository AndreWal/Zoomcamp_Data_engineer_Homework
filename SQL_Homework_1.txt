Q3

1. Between 0 and 1 mile:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS sum_mile
FROM ny_taxi_data
WHERE trip_distance >= 0 AND trip_distance <= 1;

2. Between 1 and 3 miles:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sum_mile
FROM ny_taxi_data
WHERE trip_distance > 1 AND trip_distance <= 3;

3. Between 3 and 7 miles:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sum_mile
FROM ny_taxi_data
WHERE trip_distance > 3 AND trip_distance <= 7;

4. Between 7 and 10 miles:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sum_mile
FROM ny_taxi_data
WHERE trip_distance > 7 AND trip_distance <= 10;

5. Over 10 miles:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sum_mile
FROM ny_taxi_data
WHERE trip_distance > 10;

Q4

SELECT * FROM public.ny_taxi_data
Order BY trip_distance DESC;

Q5
